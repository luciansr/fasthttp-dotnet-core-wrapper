fasthttp golang dotnet core wrapper

trying to create a faster way of doing http requests in dotnet core \
since the integrated httpclient is super slow

here goes nothing...

of course it would never work because it creates a process for every call :( \
    miserable performance

## install
install golang  \
install dotnet core \
install yarn \
run "yarn" \
run "yarn run"
